# ImageSpectator

I have never developed with Swift and this is my first program in Swift.

The first few commits of this program are based on the code output from ChatGPT (GPT-4).
I worked as per ChatGPT's output from the project creation procedure to the point where it works as a minimum function.

He makes minor mistakes, but he even corrected them by simply pasting the error codes into the prompts.

Since then, we have continued to use ChatGPT at the individual function level as we continue to refactor.

My impression is that the initial output is hard to maintain, and although it works as required, it is not extensible, but I found it very useful in shortening the time it took for a beginning user to experience the success of getting it to work.
